-- Open-ended questions: 3. Who are Fetchâ€™s power users?
-- Purpose:
-- I want to group users by demographics (age and gender) to identify which groups contain the most power users.
-- This is because identifying individual power users may not be actionable. 
-- By understanding the target audience, we can focus marketing efforts on specific demographic groups and deliver targeted ads.

-- Assumptions:
-- 1. Power Users: Defined solely by high total sales, as transaction amounts drive revenue (e.g., company earns a percentage of each transaction amount).
-- 2. Age Calculation: Derived dynamically from BIRTH_DATE using TIMESTAMPDIFF.
-- 3. Age Groups:
--    a. Young People: 0-17 years
--    b. Young Adults: 18-35 years
--    c. Middle-Aged: 36-60 years
--    d. Senior: 61+ years
-- 4. Gender Identification: Based on the GENDER column in the database.
-- 5. Data Validity: Users with null or missing AGE, GENDER, or FINAL_SALE are excluded to ensure accurate grouping.
-- 6. Target Audience: Analyzing power users by group helps optimize advertising and marketing campaigns for the most valuable demographics.

 /*
Conclusions:

1. Female Users Across Most Groups:
   - Female users outspend males in the majority of age groups.
   - Middle-Aged Females (36-60y) contribute the highest total sales and represent a loyal and valuable customer base.
   - Young Adult Females (18-35y) also demonstrate significant potential for growth and long-term retention.

2. Balanced Marketing for Elderly Users:
   - While elderly males spend more, both genders contribute meaningfully in this group.
   - Comfort, health, and ease of access should be emphasized in campaigns targeting elderly users.

3. Opportunities in Young Adults (18-35y):
   - Young Adult Females represent a promising market segment with growing purchasing power.
   - Focus on creating campaigns that promote loyalty, such as trendy, eco-friendly, or lifestyle-based subscription programs. Build a connection with this group to encourage long-term customer retention.


Business Implication:
- Middle-Aged Females (36-60y) are core power users and should be prioritized for retention campaigns with a family and health-oriented approach.
- Young Adult Females (18-35y) represent a growth opportunity; fostering loyalty in this demographic can ensure long-term revenue.
- Elderly Males (60+) should be addressed through tailored campaigns to maximize engagement and revenue.
